# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation! This repository provides comprehensive guidance on how OctoAcme delivers high-quality projects through structured yet adaptable project management processes. Whether you're a new team member onboarding or an experienced contributor looking for process details, these docs will help you understand our approach to project delivery.

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative methodology built on clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our project management framework covers the complete project lifecycle from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement. Each phase is designed to maximize customer value while maintaining team efficiency and product quality. The processes documented here apply to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

Our project management approach emphasizes collaboration across roles including Project Managers who coordinate delivery and manage risks, Product Managers who define outcomes and prioritize work, Developers who implement features, QA teams who validate quality, and Stakeholders who provide inputs and approvals. Communication is central to our success, with regular standups, weekly syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and transparent risk management. Quality assurance is embedded throughout the lifecycle with automated testing in CI, manual QA for feature acceptance, security scanning, and comprehensive end-to-end testing before releases.

The documentation is organized by project phase and functional area to make it easy to find the guidance you need. Each document includes practical templates, checklists, and examples that teams can adapt to their specific project needs. We encourage teams to reference these docs during planning, add relevant content to project repositories, and continuously improve our processes through retrospectives and feedback.
